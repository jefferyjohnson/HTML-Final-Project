			<h2>Imperial Guard</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Imperial Guard, also known as the Astra Militarum in traditional High Gothic, is the largest 
			coherent fighting force in the galaxy. They serve as the Imperium of Man's primary combat force and 
			first line of defence from the myriad threats which threaten the existence of the human race in the late 
			41st Millennium. It is comprised of countless billions of men and women -- hundreds of thousands of different
			regiments, supported by a vast array of light and heavy armoured vehicles that provide the Guard's primary
			offensive punch. They are usually the first Imperial force to respond to a threat if a planet's Planetary 
			Defence Force (PDF) fails to suppress it. They also garrison major locations of strategic or cultural interest
			to the Imperium and are often found in defensive roles. The Imperial Guard is often referred to as the 
			"Sledgehammer of the Emperor"; the sheer amount of force that the Imperial Guard can bring to bear on the 
			enemy is devastating, but is not as direct or as precise as their Space Marine allies, who are described as 
			the "Scalpel of the Emperor." There is no universal uniform or regimental command hierarchy in the Imperial 
			Guard, although it is compulsory for every regiment to have at least one Commissar to maintain the discipline 
			and morale of the men while watching for any signs of corruption or taint in the ranks. However, it is worth
			noting that a number of worlds copy the uniform used by the regiments of the Cadian Shock Troops, who are 
			viewed as being the most effective of the Imperial Guard's infantry units. The main tactic of the Imperial 
			Guard is to overwhelm the enemy with their endless numbers, while at the same time hammer them into submission
			with devastating artillery and crush them with powerful main battle tanks.</p><br>
			
			<h3 id="guardTitle">Notable Regiments of the Guard</h3>
			<div id="accordion">
				<h3><a href="#">Armageddon Steel Legion</a></h3>
				<div class="accordionText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Armageddon is a Hive World of the Segmentum Solar, an Imperial planet covered in vast polluted industrial 
				wastelands broken up by hive cities, huge human arcologies stretching miles into the sky. True to its name, 
				Armageddon has been the site of three apocalyptic battles between the Imperium and its enemies, most recently 
				a pair of invasions by the Ork Warboss Ghazghkull Thraka. As a result, the Imperial Guard regiments raised from
				Armageddon, known as the Armageddon Steel Legion, are highly skilled in combat against Greenskins. The Steel 
				Legion's soldiers are siege experts and masters of attrition, driving their wounded enemies back across the ash 
				wastelands of the planet after they have suffered severe casualties. Armageddon produces many armoured fighting 
				vehicles for the Imperium, such as Chimera APCs. As such, the Armageddon Steel Legions are primarily mechanised 
				infantry, employing Chimera armoured personnel carriers, Hellhounds and several variants of the Leman Russ main 
				battle tank. Commissar Yarrick is the best known hero of the Steel Legion, and he is greatly feared by the Orks 
				for having ripped off Ghazghkull Thraka's Power Klaw with his bare hands -- hence the fact that Yarrick is the only
				human Ghazghkull respects. In appearance, the Armageddon Steel Legion's regiments resemble the ancient German Fallschirmj√§ger
				(paratroops) deployed by Nazi Germany during World War II.</div>

				<h3><a href="#">Cadian Shock Troops</a></h3>
				<div class="accordionText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Regiments of the Cadian Shock Troops of the Imperial Guard are famous throughout the galaxy for constantly proving 
				themselves in the arena of battle. Their leader is the Lord Castellan, the position currently held by Ursarkar E. Creed, 
				hero of the Battle for Cadia during the 13th Black Crusade. The model for Cadians are the standard model for all Imperial
				Guard troopers, consequently making them the Imperial Guard's equivalent of the Ultramarines, who serve as the model for
				all standard Space Marine Chapters. Cadia has always been an Imperial Fortress World, charged with guarding the great Warp
				rift of the Eye of Terror.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The population of Cadia are all destined for a military life; the birth rate and Imperial Guard or Planetary Defence Forces
				recruitment rate of the world are practically synonymous. Cadian Regiments are highly disciplined, make excellent shots and 
				use elite shock troops to lead their attacks. Such is their reputation of the Cadian Shock Troops that many other regiments 
				mimic their appearance and equipment, although their doctrines may differ.</div>
				
				<h3><a href="#">Catachan Jungle Fighters</a></h3>
				<div class="accordionText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Catachan is an Imperial death world almost completely covered in dense jungle where it seems the entire ecosystem is 
				hostile to human life. Catachan's only export is its people, who through natural selection are bred tough and strong from 
				living in such a dangerous world. Catachan Jungle Fighters are among some of the deadliest experts of jungle warfare in 
				the entire galaxy and their reputation precedes them. They make use of many close combat weapons, including the "Catachan 
				Fang", a knife measuring up to 20 inches of gleaming steel, which is the most common weapon. It is also used for settling 
				disputes between Catachans. Another knife is the Night Reaper, which is smaller and blackened, effective for use in night
				infiltration and assassinations. They are sometimes poisoned to improve their kill strength, the poisons coming directly from 
				Catachan's deadly flora and fauna. The Devil's Claw, named after the Catachan Devil, is the longest Catachan weapon, up to four
				feet long. It is closer to a sword than a knife and has achieved status among the Orks who call it "Da Cutta" with respect.
				The blade is hollow and half filled with mercury in order to improve swing strength and control, and the design of this weapon
				has been copied by Catachan regimental officers for use as a power weapon.<br><br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also make extensive use of traps, mines and other unpleasant surprises. They use traps, spring mines, shredder mines and
				plasma charges, each specializing in killing certain types of troops. The most skilled Catachan Jungle Fighters are capable
				of launching deadly ambushes, remaining unseen in the foliage and appearing only when they want to attack. Due to their tactics
				and the terrain which they specialize in, the Catachan Jungle Fighters do not use any vehicles save for the Sentinel walker 
				which is modified for jungle warfare. They also use fewer heavy weapon teams than a standard army, and those that they do have 
				favor mortars and Heavy Bolters. This leaves them undergunned compared to other Imperial Guard Regiments, but their weaponry 
				is optimal for their preferred style of combat.</div>
				
				<h3><a href="#">Death Korps of Krieg</a></h3>
				<div class="accordionText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Death Korps of Krieg is the name given to all of the Imperial Guard regiments that originate from the devastated, 
				post-nuclear Death World of Krieg in the Segmentum Tempestus. Krieg was the site of a rebellion against the Imperium of Man 
				over 1,500 standard years ago in the 40th Millennium and was bombarded with nuclear weapons followed by 500 years of grinding
				warfare to purge the heretical rebels. After all those years of nuclear destruction and bitter trench warfare, Krieg was reduced
				to a scorched, radioactive husk of a world composed of dust and mud whose surviving people were forced to retreat into underground
				hive cities to survive the toxic planetary environment. The Death Korps of Krieg are siege specialists and those regiments 
				raised on Krieg seek to repent for their former treachery against the Imperium by displaying a disturbing disregard for their 
				own lives in combat. Death Korps troops excel at wars of attrition and defensive combat in particular. They bear a strong resemblance
				to the ancient Imperial German Army in World War I, in tactics (trench warfare) as well as appearance.</div>
				
				<h3><a href="#">Mordian Iron Guard</a></h3>
				<div class="accordionText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mordian Iron Guard are the superbly drilled and accoutred regiments of the Imperial Guard that hail from the Hive World of
				Mordian. This bleak world is tidally-locked with its sun, which causes one side of it to always be bathed in perpetual darkness 
				while the other is continuously bathed in its star's radiation, leaving it a scorched and lifeless wasteland. As such, all human
				settlements on Mordian are located on the world's dark side, and the planet has well-earned its moniker as the "World of Eternal 
				Night." The people of Mordian are grim and dour by nature, respecting only discipline and duty. Their regiments are fiercely loyal 
				to their cause: the prosecution of the Emperor's enemies. In battle, these highly-disciplined soldiers present perfectly formed 
				ranks of troops to the enemy, unleashing precisely timed volleys of las-fire from behind a hedge of bayonet points. Some enemies of
				the Emperor have been misled by the Mordians' elaborate and ornate uniforms to believe they were facing amateurs, only to find the
				bright uniforms contain tough, steely-eyed and implacable warriors of the Imperium. The Mordian Iron Guard bear a slight resemblance
				to the Prussian Army under Chancellor Otto von Bismarck in the early 20th Century.</div>
