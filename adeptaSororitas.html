			<h2>The Sisters of Battle</h2>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Adepta Sororitas, also known as the Sisters of Battle and formerly known as the Daughters of the Emperor, 
			are an all-female division of the Imperial Cult's ecclesiastical Adepta known as the Ecclesiarchy or, more formally,
			as the Adeptus Ministorum.The Sisterhood's Orders Militant serve as the Ecclesiarchy's fighting arm, mercilessly 
			rooting out corruption and heresy within humanity and every organization of the Adeptus Terra. There is naturally 
			some overlap betweenthe duties of the Sisterhood and the Imperial Inquisition; for this reason, although the Inquisition
			and the Sisterhood remain entirely separate organisations, the Orders Militant of the Sisterhood also act as the Chamber 
			Militant of the Inquisition's Ordo Hereticus. The Adepta Sororitas and the Sisters of Battle are commonly regarded
			as the same organisation, but the latter title technically refers only to the Orders Militant of the Adepta
			Sororitas, the best-known part of the organization. The Sisterhood serves as the Ministorum's only official military
			force because the Decree Passive laid down by the reformist Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor held that in the wake of
			the Age of Apostasy of the 36th Millennium, the Ecclesiarchy cannot maintain any men under arms. This was supposed
			to limit the power of the Ecclesiarchy. However, the Ministorum was able to circumvent this decree by using the 
			all-female military force of the Sisterhood's Orders Militant.</p>

				<div id="tabs-1">
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patron Saint of the Sisterhood, Bearer of the Grail of Ages, Founder of the Order
					of the Ebon Chalice, Alicia Dominica is revered throughout the Imperium as both the founder and patron saint of all
					the Orders of the Adepta Sororitas. In the 36th Millennium, she ended High Lord Goge Vandire's Reign of Blood after
					condemning him for his crimes against the Emperor and beheading him. Shortly after, under the instruction of the 
					newly appointed reformist Ecclesiarch Sebastian Thor, Dominica established the Sisterhood -- the Orders Militant of
					the Adepta Sororitas, with the Sisters divided between the Convents on Terra and Ophelia VII. She herself became the
					first Canoness of the Order of the Ebon Chalice. In 650.M36, Alicia Dominica fell at the Battle of Frideswide's World,
					surviving hundreds of blows but falling to a single Traitor's lasgun blast to her heart. She was declared a saint of
					the Imperial Creed soon after.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tabs-2">
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Arabella is the patron saint of the Order of the Sacred Rose. Although this 
					long-dead martyr never led her Order in battle, it was founded in her name. She was one of five companions of Alicia 
					Dominica, the patron saint and founder of the Adepta Sororitas. She was the last of the surviving six Sisters to enter
					the Emperor's Throne Room when they were brought before him for a personal audience during the Reign of Blood in the 
					36th Millennium by the Adeptus Custodes. Arabella disappeared in the late 36th Millennium shortly after the death of 
					Saint Mina -- her ultimate fate remains unknown</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tabs-3">
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Katherine is the patron saint of the Order of Our Martyred Lady. Originally, she
					was the founder of the Order of the Fiery Heart. She was one of five companions of Alicia Dominica, the patron saint 
					and founder of the Adepta Sororitas. Known as the Shield Bearer, Katherine was regarded as Alicia Dominica's second-in-command
					and was the bearer of Dominica's Praesidium Protectiva -- a large shield said to contain a shard of the Emperor's own personal
					Power Armour, which is said to be impervious to physical attacks. Katherine was well-known for her fiery determination and 
					vengeful spirit, ever leading her Sisters at the forefront of innumerable battles and pursuing the prosecution of numerous 
					Wars of Faith against Heretics in the name of the Emperor of Mankind. She was the founder of the Order of the Fiery Heart. 
					Her Sisters came to reflect her vengeful and fiery nature. Leading her Order for many decades, she was declared a Living Saint
					within her lifetime for performing legendary acts. Eventually, Katherine met her end at the hands of evil men, when she was 
					murdered by the Witch-Cult of Mnestteus. So deeply did her Sisters mourn Katherine's loss that they renamed their Order the 
					Order of Our Martyred Lady. Unknown to her Order, sometime before her untimely death, Saint Katherine visited the world of 
					Sanctus Lys in the Palatine Sector. Beneath a shrine, in a hidden crypt, she interred her golden Power Armour and her legendary
					Power Sword, the Ardent Blade. These powerful artefacts were found centuries later and retrieved by the Living Saint, Saint Celestine.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tabs-4">
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lucia was the youngest of the five companions of Alicia Dominica, the founder and patron
					of the Adepta Sororitas. Lucia went on to become the founder of the Order of the Valorous Heart. In the late 36th Millennium,
					Saint Lucia was captured by recidivists, who gouged out her eyes and forced her to endure the death screams of a thousand
					innocents, and the murder of a number of her own Sisters, who remained resolutely silent. Mere days after word of her 
					death reached the Holy Synod, Lucia was canonised as an Imperial Saint.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="tabs-5">
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saint Mina is the patron saint of the Order of the Bloody Rose. Although this long-dead 
					martyr never led her Order in battle, it was founded in her name. She was one of the five companions of Alicia Dominica, 
					the patron and founder of the Adepta Sororitas. In the late 36th Millennium, Saint Mina was martyred by a sanguinary Chaos 
					Cult whilst at prayer in a shrine on Hydraphur. When her body was found along with the shrine, she was surrounded by the corpses
					of twenty of her attackers -- her body covered in their blood. Her personal symbol, the red rose, represents her strong 
					character and her final death.</p>
